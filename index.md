Welcome to my blog. It's my first attempt at being one of those cool tech wizards who sometimes impart invaluable 
knowledge unto others. 

I'm obviously off to a great start. 

(Warning, there will be weird sarcasm and strange jokes in this blog. `Turn back before it's too late!`)

Alongside Technical related postings, I am a Copyleftist, a Transhumanist, an avid reader and an Eastern culture enthusiast.
