Welcome to my blog. It's my first attempt at being one of those cool tech wizards who sometimes impart invaluable 
knowledge unto others. 

I'm obviously off to a great start. 

(Warning, there will be weird sarcasm and strange jokes in this blog. `Turn back before it's too late!`)

Alongside Technical related postings, I am a Copyleftist, a Transhumanist, an avid reader and an Eastern culture enthusiast.

## Some common slang found throughout the Blog
*(Used humorously, not offensively)*

***

 `Muggles (or No-majs)` -- Non-technical people (No-maj for specifically US based non-technicals) 

`Techs (or Techies)` -- Technical people 

`Wizards (Sometimes Hippie Wizards)` -- Brilliant technologists who resolved incredible problems, should garner everyone's respect (i.e. Steve Woz)

`Zuckerbergs` -- Silicon Valley, pretentious youth who live in their social bubbles (i.e. It's like Uber but for toilets!)

`Lone stars (or Buttmonkeys)` -- The techs that work in fields that don't understand their craft

`Big bros` -- A government or officials that "conveniently" pass laws that harm the Internet and related tech

`Comcasts (or Time Warners, Bells, Rogers', etc)` -- Corporation version of Big Bros

***

This list will definitely grow some more.

`Blog in Progress, I repeat, Blog in Progress! Will get better over the next months (or not)!`
