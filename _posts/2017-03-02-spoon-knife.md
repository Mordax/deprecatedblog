Playing around with the Spoon-Knife repo was interesting. I was already familiar with branches, merging (thanks [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git)) and Github Pages (it's how I'm hosting this blog right now!). 

What was new, however, was learning about rebasing and squashing multiple commits into one, easy to understand single commit. One of the more frustrating things I run into with git is the amount of commits I have to make on tiny changes with little differentiating messages (i.e. post.md updated). 

I will certainly make good use of this information in the [future.](https://wiki.cdot.senecacollege.ca/wiki/DPS909_%26_OSD600_Winter_2017_-_Lab_4#Submission)
