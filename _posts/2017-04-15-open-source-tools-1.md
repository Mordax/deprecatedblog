So for our open source course, we're doing a series of labs on open source tooling.

Some of the things we did included building our (or at least my) first Node.js
Module, adding a Linter (ESLint), learning how to automate it using package.json and finally,
using Travis CL for building.

I finally learned where this symbol comes from.

I feel like I have finally made it into the open source world. I always thought
that whoever gets to wield that badge is master at Github. Well, now I know how
to do it myself! Yay! (It's kinda sarcasm but also something I take pride in).

Basically it was my first time doing all of these.

It wasn't too difficult learning about them thanks to the very clear instructions
I was given, and I was extremely fascinated to learn how much you can automate
using Node.js. I'm starting to see why it's so popular now.
