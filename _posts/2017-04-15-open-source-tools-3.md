Now for the final installment of our series of labs on open source tooling!

This time, we learned how to set up a Node.js server and getting it deployed
to Heroku.

So [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) is one of those aforementioned "Cloud"
services that Silicon Valley keeps talking about.

I've never worked with that kind of infrastructure before, but now I can see
beyond the "buzzwordiness" of it with the practical use of it. Rather than setting
up a computer to act like a server, you can just deploy your server on Heroku
easily and have it run anything you want it to.

I found it really interesting and useful to use. Now that I know all of these
tools that seem to be every on Github, I feel like I'm definitely ready to
deploy my own projects for fun.
