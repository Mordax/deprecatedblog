In the second part of the Open source tooling series, we are introduced
to running and automating unit tests using popular frameworks.

I ended up working with [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/).

I learned how to actually unit test my code properly and how to
set up a Node.js module to actually automate the Jest unit testing framework.

The setup of these tools was actually quite easy and similar to the setup from the
previous lab.

The thing I found surprisingly interesting was the actual unit testing itself.
I have done unit testing sporadically throughout my programming degree and most
of the time, the teacher either rushed it or just didn't touch it.

It was actually quite fun and practical. The framework and automation just made
it easier to set up and more worthwhile to throw unit tests in.
