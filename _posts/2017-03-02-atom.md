So, as part of my foray into the intricacies of code editors, I have chosen to explore
the [Atom editor](https://atom.io/) and [Adobe's Brackets](http://brackets.io/) editor.

`I ended up choosing Atom over Brackets.`

Brackets was pretty great and its features were almost exactly the same as Atoms.

What won me over was more minutia than any real lack of functionality from Brackets.
I preferred the

* The modern style of Atom
* The default fonts
* The helpful welcoming tutorial that you see immediately
* The easy to understand UI

compared to Brackets.

However, I implore the reader to play with Brackets as well, as
some things (like customizing spaces and tabs) are simpler and easier to control.

This is how Atom looks with Brackets code open (sorry, no "INCEPTION" comments here):

Here's how the spacing can be adjusted:

Here's a demo of some of the extensions I winded up installing:

Aaaaand finally, another sleek theme package! ([Material](https://atom.io/themes/material-ui)) with a bonus [icon repackaging] (https://atom.io/packages/file-icons):
